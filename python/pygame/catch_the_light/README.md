## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. I dont know what you would do with it tho. LOL. Maybe you can modify it to add your own little characters. If you ever do, please do share it with me, I'd love to see.


## Note

Glitchy as fuck. I had enough of working on this, and decided it was good enough even if Carmen and Angela would constantly be jittering against the wall.
