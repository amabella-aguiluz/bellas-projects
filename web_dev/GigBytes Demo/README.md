# Gigbytes
Low-entry, byte-sized gigs


## What is GigBytes?
An app created to provide a local connection between those **who want to get things done**, and **people willing to do them.**

## Why GigBytes?
Facebook is prone to spam, job boards like LinkedIn have too high of a barrier to hurdle over. Lots of people like students or those working full-time jobs are looking to earn some extra money. This is where GigBytes comes into play-- We aim to be able to connect people to byte-sized gigs that allow people to do extra work without needing to dedicate to a full-time job.

# Main Audience
- People lacking a degree/work experience
- Part-time workers
- Full-time workers
- Stay at home mothers
